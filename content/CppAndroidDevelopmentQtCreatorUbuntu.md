# ([C++](Cpp.md)) ![Android](PicAndroid.png)![Qt Creator](PicQtCreator.png)![Ubuntu](PicUbuntu.png) [Android development using Qt Creator under Ubuntu](CppAndroidDevelopmentQtCreatorUbuntu.md)

This page describes [Android development](CppAndroidDevelopment.md)
using the [Qt Creator](CppQtCreator.md) [IDE](CppIde.md) under the
[Ubuntu](CppUbuntu.md) [operating system](CppOs.md).

-   [Install the Android SDK](CppAndroidSdkInstall.md)
-   [Install the Android NDK](CppAndroidNdkInstall.md)
-   From now, I follow the instructions of [1] in some more detail,
    for the android-lighthouse version of the 20th January 2011
-   Obtain the source code, by typing at command-line:

```
git clone git://gitorious.org/~taipan/qt/android-lighthouse.git
```

-   Move the 'android-lighthouse' folder to a suitable location. I put
    mine in '/home/richel/qtsdk-2010.04/bin/Projects'
-   In this version, I believe you do not need to modify
    '[mkspecs/android-g++/qmake.conf](CppAndroidDevelopmentQtCreatorUbuntuQmakeConf.txt)'
    anymore
-   Instead of editing the nonexisting androidconfig.sh [1], edit
    [androidconfigbuild.sh](CppAndroidDevelopmentQtCreatorUbuntuAndroidconfigbuildSh.txt).
    ANDROID\_NDK\_ROOT must be set to the android-lighthouse folder. I
    changed this from the default folder ('/usr/local/android-ndk-r5')
    to another folder ('/MyFolder/android-ndk-r5') by changing the
    following line in
    [androidconfigbuild.sh](CppAndroidDevelopmentQtCreatorUbuntuAndroidconfigbuildSh.txt):\

```
export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=/usr/local/android-ndk-r5
```

to:

```
export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=/MyFolder/android-ndk-r5
```

-   From a command-line start the
    [androidconfigbuild.sh](CppAndroidDevelopmentQtCreatorUbuntuAndroidconfigbuildSh.txt)
    script as a super-user (otherwise the final make step fails):
    
```
sudo ./androidconfigbuild.sh
```

    This takes some time...
-   Compiling Qt (as indicated by [1]) is not necessary anymore, as
    this is done in the previous step already

From this step on, I cannot find out what to do. According to [2], the
instructions come out 2-3 weeks after the 19th January 2011.
