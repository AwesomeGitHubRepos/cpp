# ([C++](Cpp.md)) ![Wine](PicWine.png) [Wine](CppWine.md)

[Wine](CppWine.md) is a [system environent (which in my definition is
sort of an operating system)](CppOs.md), as it (does not)
[emulates](CppEmulate.md) a Windows environment under Linux, to [run
Windows under Wine under Ubuntu](CppWineUbuntu.md). Among others,
[Wine](CppWine.md) can be used to (in some definitions)
[port](CppPort.md) programs from Linux to Windows.

The answer to the [Qt FAQ](CppQtFaq.md) [Can Qt Creator run under Wine
under Ubuntu?](CppQtCreatorWineUbuntu.md) seems to be no, however.
